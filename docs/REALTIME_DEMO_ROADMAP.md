# VitalGuard AI — Delivery roadmap and verified scope

> Synthetic data only. This is a software prototype, not a clinically validated medical device or clinical decision-support system.

## Delivered phases

### Phase 1 — Synthetic observation ingestion
- Deterministic stable, worsening, and recovering fictional scenarios.
- Validated ingestion endpoint: `POST /api/v1/demo/observations`.
- Persists the generated observation and synthetic model result.

### Phase 2 — Storage adapter
- SQLAlchemy adapter supports local SQLite and PostgreSQL via private `DATABASE_URL`.
- Schema creation/migration helpers and history indexes.
- **Not complete for production:** a hosted PostgreSQL instance has not been provisioned/connected in the current deployment; SQLite remains the default unless configured.

### Phase 3 — Live event delivery
- WebSocket endpoint: `/api/v1/live`.
- Observation and alert events broadcast after persistence.
- Frontend connection state, heartbeat and reconnect backoff.
- The event hub is in-process and intended for a single backend instance.

### Phase 4 — Alert lifecycle
- Persistent synthetic alerts with deduplication keys.
- Open, acknowledged and resolved states.
- Audit trail for creation and state transitions.

### Phase 5 — Live dashboard alert operations
- Backend alert inbox in Alert Center.
- Refresh, status filters, acknowledge and resolve controls.
- Connection state visible in the app shell.

### Phase 6 — Observation data quality
- `GET /api/v1/observations/quality` classifies recent records as fresh, stale, incomplete or unknown.
- Dashboard panel displays observation age and missing required fields.
- Scope is limited to a bounded history page; it cannot detect devices that never sent a reading.

### Phase 7 — Model evaluation transparency
- `GET /api/v1/model/evaluation` returns deterministic stratified synthetic holdout metrics and a confusion matrix.
- `POST /api/v1/risk/explain` returns standardized logistic-regression coefficient contributions.
- These metrics only measure agreement with generated heuristic labels. Contributions are not SHAP or causal explanations.

### Phase 8 — Explainability workbench
- Settings form sends fictional vitals to the contribution endpoint without saving a prediction.
- Displays the synthetic score and signed coefficient contributions.

### Phase 9 — Persisted history UI
- Dashboard shows recent backend predictions, model versions, timestamps, scores and a patient filter.

### Phase 10 — Release smoke checks
- `npm run smoke:api` exercises health, model metadata, CORS, prediction persistence, synthetic evaluation, explanations, quality status, NEWS2 demo scoring, alert lifecycle/audit, and the unified timeline.

### Phase 14 — NEWS2 scoring demonstration
- `POST /api/v1/scores/news2` returns parameter points for respiratory rate, SpO₂, systolic blood pressure, pulse, consciousness, temperature and supplemental oxygen.
- SpO₂ Scale 2 is restricted by an explicit authorization assertion and defaults off.
- Based on the RCP NEWS2 chart, but the software implementation is not clinically validated or approved.

### Phase 15 — NEWS2 UI workbench
- Settings contains a synthetic-input calculator showing parameter points and total.
- Scale 2 submissions are blocked until acknowledgement is checked; the checkbox is not proof of authorization.

### Phase 16–17 — NEWS2 verification
- Live API smoke test covers default scoring and the Scale 2 API gate.
- Frontend regression tests cover score rendering and the UI acknowledgement gate.

### Phase 18–19 — Maintenance and request reliability
- Weekly Dependabot updates configured for npm and Python packages.
- Alert inbox avoids unnecessary CORS preflights on GET requests.

### Phase 20 — Unified patient timeline API
- `GET /api/v1/patients/{patient_id}/timeline` combines persisted synthetic observations, alerts and alert audit events.

### Phase 21 — End-to-end workflow smoke
- Live smoke verifies prediction → persistent alert → acknowledge → resolve → audit → unified timeline.

### Phase 22 — Patient detail timeline
- Patient detail includes backend timeline events, with clear distinction from local synthetic fixtures.

### Phase 23 — Descriptive observation trends
- `GET /api/v1/observations/trends?patient_id=...` summarizes persisted series with OLS slope and insufficient-data states.
- This is descriptive history, not a forecast or clinical inference.

### Phase 24 — Trend UI
- Patient detail displays first/latest values, change and direction for backend observations.

### Phase 25–27 — Release workflow and integration
- CI runs for pull requests targeting both `main` and `phase-3-risk-engine`.
- Smoke tests cover the trend endpoint and insufficient-history state.
- Patient detail combines timeline and trend panels.

## Remaining work before any real-world use

1. Provision a managed PostgreSQL database, configure secrets in Render, and verify data survival across restart/redeploy. Define retention, backup, restore, and migration procedures.
2. Implement proper identity and role-based authorization before any sensitive or multi-user workflow. The current demo actor is not authentication.
3. Add durable cross-instance event delivery if scaling beyond one backend instance.
4. Remediate outstanding dependency advisories in controlled batches, then add production-grade observability, request limits, security review, and operational incident procedures.
5. Keep local synthetic patient lists/charts/analytics visibly separate from backend-persisted observations. Not all dashboard views consume the backend API.
6. Do not claim clinical NEWS2 compliance, SHAP, clinical accuracy, or patient deterioration prediction until independently verified against reviewed specifications and evaluated on appropriately authorized, representative data with suitable governance.

## Safety boundary

Never use real patient data. Missing or stale observations are unknown, not normal. Synthetic model metrics do not establish clinical performance, calibration, or safety. This prototype must not be used for diagnosis, triage, or treatment decisions.
