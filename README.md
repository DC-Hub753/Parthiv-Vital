# VitalGuard AI — Patient Deterioration Early-Warning Prototype

> **DEMO ONLY · SYNTHETIC DATA · NOT FOR CLINICAL USE**
>
> VitalGuard AI is a software prototype for exploring patient-observation monitoring, risk-signal visualisation and alert workflows. The included patients and observations are synthetic. The current risk model is trained on generated data and is not clinically validated.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20 or newer (Node.js 22 LTS recommended)
- npm 10 or newer
- Python 3.11+ recommended for the FastAPI backend

## Quick start

Frontend:
```bash
npm ci
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

Backend (from the repository root):
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The frontend normally runs at `http://localhost:5173`; the backend at `http://localhost:8000`. API docs are at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

## Verification commands

Run from the project root:
```bash
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build
```

Run backend tests from `backend/`:
```bash
pytest -q
```

Only describe a command as passing after it has been run successfully against the current source.

## Environment configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for local development. Vite variables prefixed with `VITE_` are bundled into browser code, so never store secrets in them.

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `VITE_DEMO_MODE` | Starts in synthetic demo mode unless explicitly set to `false`. |
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | Optional FastAPI base URL; local default is normally `http://localhost:8000`. |
| `VITE_APP_VERSION` | Frontend version label. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Optional backend database URL; SQLite is used by default. |
| `VITALGUARD_DB_PATH` | Optional local SQLite file path for tests/development. |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated allowed frontend origins. |

## Current implementation

- React, TypeScript, Vite and Tailwind frontend with dashboard, patient directory/detail, alerts, analytics and settings.
- Existing synthetic patient records, demo simulation controls and local UI persistence.
- FastAPI synthetic risk endpoint, model metadata, deterministic holdout evaluation, coefficient-contribution explanation, bounded observation history and observation quality endpoint.
- SQLAlchemy storage adapter supports local SQLite and PostgreSQL when `DATABASE_URL` is configured. A hosted PostgreSQL instance is not yet confirmed in the live deployment.
- WebSocket event delivery for persisted observations and alerts, with a reconnecting frontend client.
- Persistent demo alert lifecycle (open, acknowledged, resolved) with audit trail.
- Dashboard includes backend alert operations, observation quality, and persisted prediction history. Patient detail includes backend observation/alert/audit timeline and descriptive trends. Patient cohort, vital charts and analytics still use local synthetic fixtures.
- Interactive model evaluation and coefficient-contribution workbench in Settings.
- Source-documented NEWS2 parameter scoring demo endpoint (`POST /api/v1/scores/news2`) and Settings calculator; this is not a clinically validated or approved implementation.
- Unified persisted patient timeline (`GET /api/v1/patients/{patient_id}/timeline`) and descriptive trend endpoint (`GET /api/v1/observations/trends?patient_id=...`).
- Deterministic simulator endpoint for stable, worsening, and recovering fictional observation scenarios.

### Phase 1 API: synthetic observation ingestion

Endpoint:
`POST /api/v1/demo/observations`

Example request:
```json
{
  "patient_id": "DEMO-LIVE-001",
  "scenario": "worsening",
  "step": 3
}
```

Supported scenarios: `stable`, `worsening`, `recovering`. Step must be between 0 and 1000. The endpoint generates one deterministic observation for the requested scenario and step, runs the current synthetic risk model, and persists the resulting observation/prediction using the configured storage adapter.

Example local request:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/demo/observations \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"patient_id":"DEMO-LIVE-001","scenario":"worsening","step":3}'
```

History can be inspected at:
`GET /api/v1/observations?patient_id=DEMO-LIVE-001`

This is a one-observation-per-request simulator, not a continuous device feed. Each request creates a new observation; requests are not idempotent. The backend broadcasts saved observations and alerts over `/api/v1/live`, and the dashboard includes backend alert, history, timeline and trend views. Not all patient cards/charts are API-backed. Durable hosted PostgreSQL configuration remains outstanding.

## Important limitations

- Patient directory, vital charts, cohort analytics and some local alert cards still use local synthetic fixtures; backend history and alert operations are separate views.
- The model is a StandardScaler + LogisticRegression classifier trained on generated synthetic observations and heuristic labels. Its output is a demo signal, not a validated probability of clinical deterioration.
- Model evaluation metrics describe agreement with synthetic heuristic labels only. Coefficient contributions are not SHAP explanations or causal attributions.
- WebSocket fan-out is in-process and designed for a single backend instance. Hosted PostgreSQL, identity/role controls, and production operational safeguards remain deployment work.
- The NEWS2 scoring endpoint follows parameter bands from the RCP chart for demonstration, but the implementation is not clinically validated or approved. The existing local NEWS2-like display also remains a separate synthetic fixture.
- No clinical performance, safety, regulatory or real-device integration is claimed.
- Do not use real patient data or use this prototype to diagnose, triage, or make treatment decisions.

## Database configuration

- Local development defaults to SQLite.
- Hosted deployments can set `DATABASE_URL` to a PostgreSQL connection string. The adapter normalizes common `postgres://` and `postgresql://` URLs to psycopg 3.
- Configure credentials only in the backend service's private environment settings; do not commit them.
- Provision the hosted database separately. Existing SQLite records are not automatically migrated.
- This storage adapter currently supports synthetic demonstration data only; it is not a production patient-record system.

## Live API smoke test

Run `npm run smoke:api` to check health, model metadata, frontend CORS preflight, synthetic prediction and persistence, model evaluation, coefficient contributions, NEWS2 scoring/Scale 2 guard, data quality, alert acknowledgement/resolution and audit trail. This writes fictional records to the configured demo database.

- Workflow: `.github/workflows/live-api-smoke.yml`
- Script: `scripts/smoke-test.mjs`
- Run via GitHub Actions → Live API smoke test → Run workflow.
- The workflow creates synthetic demo records; never send real patient data.

## Roadmap

See [docs/REALTIME_DEMO_ROADMAP.md](docs/REALTIME_DEMO_ROADMAP.md) for phases, acceptance criteria, and current limitations. See [docs/RENDER_RELEASE_RUNBOOK.md](docs/RENDER_RELEASE_RUNBOOK.md) for the actual Render service branches, deploy verification, and release smoke-test procedure. The delivered phase status and remaining deployment requirements are tracked in the roadmap. Hosted PostgreSQL, identity/access controls, cross-instance event delivery, and any clinically meaningful model remain outstanding.
